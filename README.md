## Conway's Game Of Life (in Scala)

## Underpopulation
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

## Overpopulation
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.

## Community / Continuity
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.

## Birth / Rebirth
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours cells will come to life.
