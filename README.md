Conway's Game Of Life

## Under Population
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by needs caused by underpopulation.

## Over Populiation
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.

## Continuity
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.

## Birth
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours cells will come to life.
