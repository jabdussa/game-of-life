## Underpopulation
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.


## Overpopulation
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.


## Community / Continuity
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.


## Birth / Rebirth
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours cells will come to life.


## Details
The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 

The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously 
to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, 
and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick 
(in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). 

The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
